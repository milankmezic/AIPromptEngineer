AI Prompt Engineer is a modern web-based tool for building, refining, and engineering prompts for large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI GPT and Google Gemini. It provides a guided, wizard-style interface to help users craft comprehensive prompts, experiment with model parameters, and interact with AI in a structured way.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/milankmezic/AIPromptEngineer.git
   cd AIPromptEngineer
   ```

2. **Open the App:**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser (Chrome recommended).
   - No build step or server required.

3. **Configure API Settings:**
   - Click the settings (gear) icon.
   - Enter your OpenAI or Gemini API key, model, and (optionally) base URL.
   - Adjust parameters as needed.

4. **Start Engineering Prompts:**
   - Click "Get Started" and follow the wizard to build your prompt.
   - Review, refine, and send prompts to the AI.
   - Use the chat interface for follow-up questions and iterative refinement.
   - Click on automatically generated follow-up suggestions to continue the conversation.

## Parameters and URL Prefill

You can prefill the API key, model, and base URL fields by passing them as URL parameters when opening the app. This is useful for sharing links or automating configuration.

- `key`: Your API key (e.g., OpenAI or Gemini)
- `model`: The model name (e.g., `gpt-4`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`)
- `url`: The base API URL (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/v1`)

**Example:**
```
https://yourdomain.com/index.html?key=YOUR_API_KEY&model=gpt-4&url=https://api.openai.com/v1
```

When you open the app with these parameters, the corresponding fields will be pre-filled automatically.

## Recent Updates

- **Automatic Follow-up Suggestions:** The AI now generates contextual follow-up actions after each response
- **Enhanced UX:** Auto-focus on input fields and clickable header navigation
- **Improved Defaults:** Set to use `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` by default
- **Streamlined Interface:** Removed stream option for cleaner settings panel
- **GitHub Integration:** Direct link to latest version on GitHub from splash screen
