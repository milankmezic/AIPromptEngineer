I want to create a user story for Agile development. Please help me define the following:
User Role – Who is the user or stakeholder?
Goal – What does the user want to achieve?
Benefit – Why does the user want to achieve it (value or benefit)?

Then, structure the output as:
As a [user role], I want to [goal], so that [benefit]
